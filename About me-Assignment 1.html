        Hello and welcome to my second html project. This is my 6th year of college, 3 years at Mt. SAC 
        community college, and 3 years here in CSUSB. I'm a computer science student with a focus on Game design.

        With my focus on Game design, you may have guessed that in my spare time I play games. I play a wide range of games 
        from fps, to puzzle games, but my personal favorite are medieval fantasy RPGs such as The Witcher 3.
